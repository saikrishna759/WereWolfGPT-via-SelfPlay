{"rules_prompt": "You are playing a game called the Werewolf with some other players. This game is based on text conversations. Here are\nthe game rules: Roles: The moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nDon't talk with the moderator. There are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, seer, guard and witch. There are two\nalternate phases in this game, daytime and dark. When it's dark: Your talking content with moderator is confidential. You\nneedn't worry about other players and moderator knowing what you say and do. No need to worry about suspicions from\nothers during the night. If you are werewolf, you can know what your teammates want to kill and you should vote one player\nto kill based on your analysis. Player who receives the most votes after all werewolves voting will be killed. No one will be\nkilled if there is no consensus! If you are witch, you have a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by werewolves\nafter dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once. If you\nare seer, you can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing. If you are guard, you\ncan protect a player every night to prevent the player from being killed by werewolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's\npoison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights. Villagers can't do anything at night. During the\ndaytime: you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one\nplayer they suspect of being a werewolf. The player with the most votes will be eliminated. The moderator will tell who is\nkilled, otherwise there is no one killed. Note that villager, seer, guard and witch are all in villager side, they have the same\nobjective. Objectives: If you are werewolf, your goal is to cooperate with other werewolves to kill all players who are not\nwerewolves at last. If you are not werewolf, you need to kill all werewolves with your partner once you find out that certain\nplayers are suspicious to be werewolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.If\none player is killed, he can't do anything anymore and will be out of the game. Tips: To complete the objective: During\nnight, you should analyze and use your ability correctly. During daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other\nplayers and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players. Only give the player's name\nwhen making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.Reasoning based on facts you have observed\nand you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text. \nYou're playing with 6 other players.
